## Preface

Welcome to the official TShock for Terraria downloaded documentation. This guide will walk through the installation and basic configuration of your newly downloaded TShock server, and should provide a basic knowledge as to how to get help from outside resources if needed.

## Resources

* [The Confluence wiki](http://develop.tshock.co:8080/) contains the most up to date information compiled by the community members. If your question isn't answered here, you might find it there.
* [The forums](http://tshock.co/xf/) provide an excellent place to ask other TShock users and developers questions. Please refrain from making posts about questions that may be answered here, however.
* [Our Github page](http://github.com/TShock/TShock) is where you'll be able to find the source code and the bug tracker.
* [IRC](irc://irc.shankshock.com/terraria) is our IRC channel, if you prefer that medium for support.
* Lastly, we can be found in the "Nyx" channel on the Teamspeak 3 server: ts3.shankshock.com, port 9987.
